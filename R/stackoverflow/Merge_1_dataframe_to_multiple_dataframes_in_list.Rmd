# The problem

I have a list of ten dataframes (DFList). I have one dataframe (DFMain) I want to merge to each of them (DFList) in an lapply function. They share the Column1, named Column1, which is the column I am merging by. It works for the first dataframe in the list, but ignores the rest of them. What am I missing? Thanks!

```{r eval = F}
mymerge<-function(x){
    x<- merge(x, DFMain, by.x=c("Column1"), by.y=("Column1"), all.x=TRUE);
};

finishedmerge<-lapply(DFList, mymerge);
```

# The solution

```{r}
library(magrittr)
DFMain <- iris %>% dplyr::mutate(id = 1:dplyr::n())
DFList <- lapply(1:10, function(x, DFMain){
  return(DFMain)
}, DFMain)
purrr::red

lapply(DFList, function(df, DFMain ))
```
